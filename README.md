## 💻 The first project is to explore the COVID-19 dataset With SQL
#### - we have 2 datasets ( COVID-19 death && COVID-19 Vaccinations )


✅ At the start I explore the two dataset
✅ Then show the percent of deaths for total cases in Egypt
✅ Then show the percent of cases for the population in Egypt
✅ Then Show the highest Percentage of Death for each country
✅ Then show the highest Percentage of Infected for each country
✅ Then show the Highest number of death cases  for each country
✅ Then show the number of infected people and dead people in each continent
✅ Then the number of infected people and dead people in the whole world by date
✅ Then the total of all cases 
✅ Then join 2 datasets and Look at population and vaccinations
✅ Then Using CTE to show new_vaccinations and people vaccinated
✅ Then Use a Temporary Table to show the vaccination rate
✅ Then Create a View to store data for visualization

## After Making The Analysis with SQL Creating dashboard with Tableau, featuring:

🌍 Global Numbers
📊 Total Deaths per Continent
🗺️ Percent of Population Vaccinated per Country
🗺️ Percent of Population Infected per Country
📈 Population Infected Percentage for Selected Countries
