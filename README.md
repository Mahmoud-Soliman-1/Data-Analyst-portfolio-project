## 💻 The first project is to explore the COVID-19 dataset With SQL
#### - we have 2 datasets ( COVID-19 death && COVID-19 Vaccinations )


✅ At the start I explore the two datasets <br>
✅ Then show the percent of deaths for total cases in Egypt <br>
✅ Then show the percent of cases for the population in Egypt <br>
✅ Then Show the highest Percentage of Death for each country <br>
✅ Then show the highest Percentage of Infected for each country <br>
✅ Then show the Highest number of death cases  for each country <br>
✅ Then show the number of infected people and dead people in each continent <br>
✅ Then the number of infected people and dead people in the whole world by date <br>
✅ Then the total of all cases  <br>
✅ Then join 2 datasets and Look at population and vaccinations <br>
✅ Then Using CTE to show new_vaccinations and people vaccinated <br>
✅ Then Use a Temporary Table to show the vaccination rate <br>
✅ Then Create a View to store data for visualization <br> <br>

## After Making The Analysis with SQL Create a dashboard with Tableau, featuring: <br> <br>

🌍 Global Numbers <br>
📊 Total Deaths per Continent <br>
🗺️ Percent of Population Vaccinated per Country <br>
🗺️ Percent of Population Infected per Country <br>
📈 Population Infected Percentage for Selected Countries <br> <br>
